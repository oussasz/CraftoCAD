# CraftoCAD  
a self-made, non-professional website built purely for learning purposes. It's my playground for exploring web design and development—without any prior coding experience!  

## Why?  
Because why not? I'm not a programmer, but that won't stop me from trying! 💻  
This project is a mix of trial, error, and a lot of Googling. If you're a developer, feel free to laugh... but also, feel free to help! 😆  

## Features  
✔️ Built with pure curiosity  
✔️ 100% self-taught mistakes included  
✔️ Might break at any moment (stay alert!)  

## Disclaimer  
This is not a professional project (yet). Explore at your own risk! 😜
